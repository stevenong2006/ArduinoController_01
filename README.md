# ArduinoController_01
This project shows how implement a protocol to control the Arduino UNO. Applying the client/server concept, the Arduino will be treated as a server. A simple client GUI will be implemented in C#.
In part 1, we will:
1. Design/implement the protocol
2. Design/implement the Client GUI
3. Design/implement the communication
